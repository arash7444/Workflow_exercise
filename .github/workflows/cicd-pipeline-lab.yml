### PRACTICE CHALLENGE 1 ###
# TASK: Configure workflow triggers to run on pushes to main branch and pull requests 
# targeting main branch. Add path filtering to only trigger when files in 'src/' or 'tests/' 
# directories change.

  ### PRACTICE CHALLENGE 2 ###
  # TASK: Create a build job that sets up Python 3.9, installs requirements from requirements.txt, 
  # and runs pytest with coverage reporting. The job should fail if tests don't pass.

    # Add steps for:
    # 1. Checkout code
    # 2. Set up Python 3.9 with pip caching
    # 3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
    # 4. Run pytest with coverage reporting

# ==================================================

  ### PRACTICE CHALLENGE 3 ###
  # TASK: Add Docker build and push steps that create an image tagged with both 'latest' 
  # and the Git commit SHA, then push to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.
  # YOUR CODE HERE
  
  # docker-build:
  #   # Configure job dependency on build-and-test
  #   needs: # specify job dependency
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
  #   steps:
  #   # Add steps for:
  #   # 1. Checkout code  
  #   # 2. Set up Docker Buildx
  #   # 3. Login to container registry
  #   # 4. Build and push Docker image with multiple tags
